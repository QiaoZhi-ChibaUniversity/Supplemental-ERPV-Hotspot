## ‚öôÔ∏è How to Use

‚öôÔ∏è How to Use
1. Prepare the data
Place your input .csv files in a local directory.
Each file should be named according to site and observation metadata (e.g., 0,0_AUC_EBF_2018_0329.csv).

Each file must contain at least the following columns:
TIME, SOZ, SAZ, SOA, SAA, RED, NIR
where:

SOZ, SAZ, SOA, and SAA represent solar/satellite zenith and azimuth angles.

RED and NIR represent red and near-infrared reflectance.

2. Place the model scripts
Ensure the following custom Python modules are placed in the same directory as the main script:

Func_LSR_Kgeo.py

Func_RossThick_Kvol.py

Func_Maignan2004_Kvol.py

These contain kernel functions required by the RTLSR, Jiao2016, and Maignan2004 models.

3. Edit the input file path
In the main script (e.g., main_fitting_script.py), set the path to the .csv file you wish to process:


file_path = r'F:/data/your_csv_file.csv'
Note: Use raw string format (r'...') or double backslashes for Windows paths.

4. Run the script
Execute the script in your Python environment (e.g., Spyder, VSCode, or terminal):

5. Output
The script prints fitting metrics (R¬≤, RMSE, BIAS) and model parameters for each band and model.

Results are stored in a dictionary named fitting_results.

You may extend the code to export fitted values or plots.
